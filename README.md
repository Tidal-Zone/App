## Development

This project contains the base of an [App Fair](https://www.appfair.net) app,
which is an application distribution platform for native SwiftUI applications.

Fork this project into an organization name *App Name* to use as the basis 
for your own app, then submit a PR to have it automatically
built and distributed through the [App Fair catalog](https://www.appfair.net).

To get started building your own app using only your web browser:

1. Create a [new GitHub Organization](https://github.com/account/organizations/new?plan=team_free). The organization's name will uniquely identify your app and should consist of two short words (no numbers) separated by a single hyphen. For example: `App-Name`.
1. Set the public e-mail in the Organization settings to be to same as your GitHub e-mail address.
1. [Fork the appfair/App repository](https://github.com/appfair/App/fork) into your new `App-Name` organization. The fork must reside in an organization rather than your personal account.
1. Open the App fork's `About` panel and set the description to be a brief (< 80 character) single-sentence summary of your application, then add a single topic starting with "appfair-", such as `appfair-utilities`.
1. Update your App fork's [settings](../../settings#features) to enable **Issues** and **Discussions**.
1. [Edit AppFairApp.xcconfig](../../edit/main/AppFairApp.xcconfig) and update `PRODUCT_NAME` to be `App Name` (the app name with a space) and `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` to be `app.App-Name`.
1. [Edit this README.md](../../edit/main/README.md) file to describe and document your app. The `#Description` section will be published as part of your App's catalog information.
1. [Edit Sources/App/AppContainer.swift](../../edit/main/Sources/App/AppContainer.swift) and add some SwiftUI code to the `ContentView.body`.
1. [Enable actions](../../actions) for the App fork, which will be used to validate the App settings, as well as build and publish releases.
1. Create a [new 0.0.1 release](../../releases/new?target=main&tag=0.0.1) for the `main` branch. The release tag must match the `MARKETING_VERSION` key in the `AppFairApp.xcconfig` file. Release notes can be entered into the description field. Specify "pre-release" and hit the `Publish release` button.
1. Wait for the [release action](../../actions) to complete successfully, then verify that the release artifacts are available on the [releases page](../../releases).
1. [Create a Pull Request (PR)](../../compare) to the the base `/appfair/App/` repository with the title: `app.App-Name` (matching the `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` in the `AppFairApp.xcconfig` file).
1. Submit the PR and monitor the status of its check actions, which will validate the app release and update the App Fair catalog. The PR will be closed automatically once it has completed.

Your release build will shortly become available in the [App Fair](https://www.appfair.net) catalog browser application (with the "Pre-release" preference enabled), as well as automatically published to the homebrew catalog, from where it can be installed with the terminal command:

```shell
$ brew install appfair/app/app-name-prerelease
```

Download, share and enjoy!
